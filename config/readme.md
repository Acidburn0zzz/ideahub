These files contain secret API keys, etc, that you wouldn't want to commit to git. For example, adding your Firebase project key and API key here will connect your app to your Firebase database.

To add an API key etc, first rename the file and remove the `.example`. Then copy and past your keys into the file and save. Double check that the file isn't going to be committed (the file name should be in the `.gitignore` file).
