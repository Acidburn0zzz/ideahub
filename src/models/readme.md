# Models

Your models are code that get data from a server somewhere. Having this code separated into its own modules helps keep your app well-organized. These are mostly used by the React views in `/client`, but could be imported by scripts and functions too.

All of these models inherit methods from the `Supermodel.js` file, which contains a bunch of convenient functions for working with Firebase.
