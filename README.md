**Making websites is still too hard.**

Building a static HTML/CSS site is pretty easyâ€”but building log in, forms, and search is way harder. Most people who try to learn just give up.

Firefly is a modern web app boilerplate for junior devs who just want to make something cool. Firefly uses a lot of, but does without Redux and a lot of the complicated things that get in the way of shipping. Think of it as a tiny alternative to Rails for people learning JS.

I built Firefly for myself to help me with my own projects. I hope you use it to make something of your own.

## App Structure

- [`/functions`](https://github.com/sampl/firefly/tree/master/functions) - contains the little backend code necessary for the app (just one function to update our search index when a post chances).
- [`/public`](https://github.com/sampl/firefly/tree/master/public) - files that will be available as-is when you go live
- [`/scripts`](https://github.com/sampl/firefly/tree/master/scripts) - little javascript scripts you can manually run on your database. Useful for adding dummy data, "migrations", etc.
- [`/src`](https://github.com/sampl/firefly/tree/master/src) - contains most of the app. These are create components that are compiled into a single JS file and sent to the user's browser.
- [`/src/actions`](https://github.com/sampl/firefly/tree/master/src/actions) - plain old javascript functions that "do things" in your app like log out or create a post (similar to MVC "controllers")
- [`/src/data`](https://github.com/sampl/firefly/tree/master/src/data) - react components that get data from your Firebase database for your views (think "models" in MVC)
- [`/src/styles`](https://github.com/sampl/firefly/tree/master/src/styles) - low-level react components for use in your views (replaces your CSS/SASS files)
- [`/src/views`](https://github.com/sampl/firefly/tree/master/src/views) - mostly-stateless react components that show your app's UI ("views" in MVC)
