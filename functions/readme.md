# Functions

This folder contains all of your app's backend code. Instead of running this code on a server, we're using Firebase Cloud Functions.

Because Firebase is a backend-as-a-service, you don't have to write a lot of the backend code that you do in a Ruby on Rails app or another "normal" backend. For example, you don't need to write code here to authenticate users, store sessions, validate form data, or retrieve and send stuff from the database.
